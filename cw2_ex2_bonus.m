%% PROBLEM SPECIFICATION:

blockSize = 5 ; % This will function as the dimension of the road basis
% images (blockSize x blockSize), as well as the view range, in rows of
% your car (including the current row).

n_MiniMapBlocksPerMap = 5 ; % determines the size of the test instance.
% Test instances are essentially road bases stacked one on top of the
% other.

basisEpsisodeLength = blockSize - 1 ; % The agent moves forward at constant speed and
% the upper row of the map functions as a set of terminal states. So 5 rows
% -> 4 actions.

episodeLength = blockSize*n_MiniMapBlocksPerMap - 1 ;% Similarly for a complete
% scenario created from joining road basis grid maps in a line.

%discountFactor_gamma = 1 ; % if needed

rewards = [ 1, -1, -20 ] ; % the rewards are state-based. In order: paved
% square, non-paved square, and car collision. Agents can occupy the same
% square as another car, and the collision does not end the instance, but
% there is a significant reward penalty.

probabilityOfUniformlyRandomDirectionTaken = 0.15 ; % Noisy driver actions.
% An action will not always have the desired effect. This is the
% probability that the selected action is ignored and the car uniformly
% transitions into one of the above 3 states. If one of those states would
% be outside the map, the next state will be the one above the current one.

roadBasisGridMaps = generateMiniMaps ; % Generates the 8 road basis grid
% maps, complete with an initial location for your agent. (Also see the
% GridMap class).

noCarOnRowProbability = 0.8 ; % the probability that there is no car
% spawned for each row

seed = 1234;
rng(seed); % setting the seed for the random nunber generator

% Call this whenever starting a new episode:
MDP = generateMap( roadBasisGridMaps, n_MiniMapBlocksPerMap, blockSize, ...
    noCarOnRowProbability, probabilityOfUniformlyRandomDirectionTaken, ...
    rewards );


%% Initialising the state observation (state features) and setting up the
% exercise approximate Q-function:
stateFeatures = ones( 4, 5 );
action_values = zeros(1, 3);

Q_test1 = ones(4, 5, 3);
Q_test1(:,:,1) = 100;
Q_test1(:,:,3) = 100;% obviously this is not a correctly computed Q-function; it does imply a policy however: Always go Up! (though on a clear road it will default to the first indexed action: go left)

W= zeros(3, 3);

%% TEST ACTION TAKING, MOVING WINDOW AND TRAJECTORY PRINTING:
% Simulating agent behaviour when following the policy defined by
% $pi_test1$.
%
% Commented lines also have examples of use for $GridMap$'s $getReward$ and
% $getTransitions$ functions, which act as our reward and transition
% functions respectively.
